# Solidity Tutorial (Web3 Backend)

Welcome to this Solidity Tutoring Section!

## Overview

Welcome to this Solidity Tutorial!

This repository is a comprehensive guide to learning Solidity, the high-level programming language used for writing smart contracts on blockchain platforms, notably Ethereum. The tutorial covers essential concepts such as smart contracts, the importance of learning Solidity, and its applications in decentralized applications (DApps) and financial innovation.

Throughout this tutorial, we will cover various topics, including:

- Introduction to Solidity: Understand the basics of Solidity programming language and its syntax.
- Introduction to Remix: Learn how to use Remix, an online Solidity IDE, for writing, deploying, and testing Solidity smart contracts.
- Remix Storage Factory: Explore more advanced concepts in Remix, such as deploying contracts using the Storage Factory pattern.
- Remix Fund Me: Dive into creating more complex contracts in Remix, like a crowdfunding contract.
- EthersJs: Learn how to interact with Ethereum blockchain using EthersJs library.
- Introduction to Hardhat: Discover Hardhat, a development environment for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging Ethereum software.
- Hardhat Simple Storage: Build your first Solidity contract using Hardhat and deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain.
- Hardhat FundMe: Extend your knowledge by creating a crowdfunding contract using Hardhat.
- Introduction to Blockchain Oracles: Understand the role of oracles in connecting smart contracts with off-chain data.
- Deploying your first contract to a testnet: Learn how to deploy your Solidity contract to a testnet environment.
- Creating your first Token: Dive into creating your own ERC20 token.
- Creating your first Non-Fungible Token: Explore the world of NFTs by creating your first Non-Fungible Token.
- Creating your NFT Marketplace: Learn how to create a decentralized marketplace for trading NFTs.
- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOâ€™s): Understand the concept of DAOs and how they function on the blockchain.
- Security and Auditing: Explore security best practices and auditing techniques for Solidity smart contracts.

Whether you're new to Solidity or looking to deepen your understanding, this tutorial provides a comprehensive learning path to help you become proficient in Solidity and blockchain development.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to lay the very basic foundation and deeper insights for understanding Solidity and its applications in blockchain development. Whether you're new to Solidity or looking to refresh your knowledge, this introduction aims to provide you with a starting point for exploring the world of decentralized applications.

## Sections

### 1.Introduction to Solidity

Everything carried out in this introduction section was purely carried out on Remix, an online Solidity IDE available at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/). Remix provides a user-friendly environment for writing, deploying, and testing Solidity smart contracts directly in your web browser.
